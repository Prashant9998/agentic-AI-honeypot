# ✅ Frontend Deployed

You requested the "react output file".

## Actions Taken
1.  Ran `npm run build` to generate the production React app.
2.  Force-added the `dist` folder to Git (it was previously ignored).
3.  Pushed the built frontend to GitHub.

## Result
Your Render deployment will now serve the **Cyber Sentinel Dashboard** at your main API URL:

👉 **[https://agentic-ai-scam-honeypot.onrender.com](https://agentic-ai-scam-honeypot.onrender.com)**

(Wait 3-5 minutes for Render to redeploy)

## Hackathon Validator
The Validator will still work because the API endpoints (`/api/honeypot`, etc.) are still active on the same URL.
