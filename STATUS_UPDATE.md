# ✅ API Status: ONLINE

The "issue" you saw (`"message": "API is running, but frontend not built yet"`) was actually a **SUCCESS message**! It meant your API server was up and running.

## What I Fixed
To make it less confusing, I upgraded the server code. Now, when you visit the API URL in a browser, instead of that raw JSON message, you will see a nice status page:

> **Cyber Sentinel API 🛡️**
> Status: **ONLINE**

## What You Should Do
**You don't need to wait.** Your API is already working. You can go to the **Hackathon Validator** right now and submit!

**API URL:** `https://agentic-ai-scam-honeypot.onrender.com`
**API Key:** `honeypot123`

Good luck! 🚀
